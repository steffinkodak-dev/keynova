# KeyNova — Bill of Materials (BOM)

| # | Part | Purpose | Qty | Notes |
|---|------|---------|-----|-------|
| 1 | **ESP32 DevKit V1** | Microcontroller “brain” | 1 | Built-in Bluetooth; easy to program with Arduino IDE |
| 2 | **WS2812B / SK6812 LED strip (5V, 60 LED/m)** | Addressable lights above keys | 1 roll | Match length to keyboard (61 or 88 keys); limit brightness to ~30–40% |
| 3 | **5V USB power bank (≥2A)** | Power source | 1 | Phone power bank is fine |
| 4 | **Electrolytic capacitor 1000–2200 µF (≥6.3V)** | Power stabilization | 1 | Solder across +5V and GND near LED strip input |
| 5 | **Breadboard + jumper wires** | Prototyping | 1 set | Helpful during first tests |
| 6 | **USB cable (Micro-USB or USB-C)** | Programming + power | 1 | Match your ESP32 port |
| 7 | **Diffuser channel / clear rail (optional)** | Even lighting & aesthetics | 1 set | Helps spread light over keys |
| 8 | **INMP441 I²S mic (optional)** | Sound-reactive mode | 1 | Add in Week 4 (not needed for MVP) |
| 9 | **Foam tape / low-tack adhesive** | Mount LED strip safely | 1 roll | Protects piano surface |

> ⚠️ **Power tip:** Full-white can draw ~60 mA per LED. Keep brightness low and/or test short sections first. Always **share ground** between ESP32 and LED strip.
